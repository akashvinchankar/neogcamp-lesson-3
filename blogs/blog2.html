      <p><strong>Hey Folks,</strong></p>
      <p>How are you?</p>
      <p>
        Worried about what to choose path for your career?! Don't worry I will
        try to help you make your decision better.
      </p>

      <p>First we will try to get basic understanding about both the fields.</p>

      <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence</h2>

      <p>
        Sounds interesting! This is the field of computer science which is based
        on machine learning and deep learning. This is used to perfrom some
        tasks without human intervenstion. This include speech recognition,
        problem solving and planning. Machines are made to think like humans by
        learning some algorithms.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Applications of AI:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Self-Driving and Self-Parking Vehicles</li>
        <li>Digital Assistants (alexa, siri, etc)</li>
        <li>Whether Predictions</li>
        <li>Robots etc</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong
          >The things which you need to learn for becoming an AI Engineer are:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python and its libraries</li>
        <li>Data Visualizarion</li>
        <li>Data Analysis</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Data Mining</li>
        <li>Neural Networks and Computer Vision</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You need to develop good analytical and mathematical skills as this
        learing involves some mathematical formulas to get the algorithm
        implemented.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Web / Application Development</h2>

      <p>
        Development is interesting! This involves creativeness and attention to
        details. You have to design websites and mobile apps. The websites we
        browse the apps we use are develped by various web / application
        developers.It is a very diverse field and involves various roles like
        Web Developement with different frameworks, Android Development and iOS
        Development.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Web / App Development involves: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Frontend Development</li>
        <li>Backend Development</li>
        <li>UI / UX Designing</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong
          >The things which you need to learn for becoming an Web Developer are:
        </strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React.js / Angular.js / Vue.js any of these frameworks</li>
        <li>Node.js for backend</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>Redux & many more</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong
          >The things which you need to learn for becoming an Application
          Developer are:
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>App developers are for both Android & iOS</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Kotlin</li>
        <li>Swift</li>
        <li>Objective C</li>
        <li>Flutter</li>
        <li>React Native etc</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In this developement you don't need to be good at maths rather you
        should be good at design and developement. Key point in development is
        practice, the more you build the more you get expertise in the
        developing.
      </p>

      <h2>Verdict</h2>

      <p>
        There is noting like AI id good or development is good, both hold their
        positions very well and have good career opportunities too. You need to
        just think and try the basics of both of them to get a clear
        understanding. Trying that will help you to come on an end decision,
        what's your cup of tea and and in what field you can be comfortable
        pursuing your carrier.
      </p>

      <p>Hope this information will help you to decide.</p>
      <p><strong>Thank You!!</strong></p>
