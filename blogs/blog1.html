    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Hey There,</strong></p>
        <p>I'm Akash Vinchankar,</p>

        <p>Have you started a blog and struggled for traffic, don't worry I will help you out.</p>

        <p> And if till now haven't started a blog. Start a Blog right away.</p>

        <p>You already know that a blog needs to have traffic to have some sort of income.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NO TRAFFIC = NO MONEY</strong></p>

        <p>Blog Niche decides how much traffic do you want to generate some income.</p>

        <p>Let's take an example to make it simple.</p>

        <p>There are two types of blog income one is Adsense and the other is Affiliate Marketing.</p>

        <p>If your niche is related to some information that provides some value to the readers then you should be going
            for Adsense. Like the search volume also plays a very important role and the number of people visiting the
            website is important for that Blog as the larger is the number of audiences more is Adsense revenue because
            more ads will be seen by people.</p>

        <p>But the above case is not the same for the Affiliate Marketer. Because affiliate marketing doesn't work
            with the traffic it has more to do with the targeted audience and the conversion rate of the audience.
            Affiliate marketing works on sales and you need to have genuinely interested buyers for your affiliate
            product.</p>

        <p>Affiliate Program Examples are:- Amazon Affiliate, etc.</p>

        <p>The traffic from different countries has different CPC.</p>

        <p>If your target county is the USA and you get traffic from there you will have the highest CPC. Likewise, CPC
            differs from country to country and Niche by Niche.</p>

        <p> Now, Enough knowledge I guess.</p>

        <p> Let's get straight on to the point of <em>HOW TO GET TRAFFIC?</em></p>

        <p> There are various methods to get traffic to your Blog
            <ol>
